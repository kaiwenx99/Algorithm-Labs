    ### This whole main() function has this output, for me:
    """

** testing init and repr **
first should have a repr() (or a str()) so that it can be printed: LLN(alice)

** insertAfter **
we did first.insertAfter(bob), so now second should exist too, and contain bob: LLN(bob)

** more insertAfter **
we did second.insertAfter(carol), so now third should exist too, and contain carol: LLN(carol)

** toList **
I'd like to be able to print them out in a normal Python list
Everything (as a list) starting from second (should be 2 things): ['bob', 'carol']
Everything (as a list) starting from first (should be 3 things): ['alice', 'bob', 'carol']
Let me prove that it returns a list.  What's the type?  It's: <class 'list'>

** more checking of longer LinkedLists **
we just added 'dave' after the third node
the whole linked list (as a list): ['alice', 'bob', 'carol', 'dave']
starting at third: ['carol', 'dave']
starting at fourth: ['dave']

** findLast **
this should get dave (who is last):  LLN(dave)
this should also get dave (who is last):  LLN(dave)

** inserting works in the middle **
I added a cat after bob, it should appear before carol: ['alice', 'bob', 'cat', 'carol', 'dave']
I added a dog after bob, it should appear before the cat: ['alice', 'bob', 'dog', 'cat', 'carol', 'dave']

** findAfter **
I can find bob after alice: LLN(bob)
But if I try to find alice after bob, I get an exception
KEY ERROR 'alice'
Similarly I cannot find cat AFTER cat, I get an exception
KEY ERROR 'cat'
But the dave is after the cat, that's fine: LLN(dave)
